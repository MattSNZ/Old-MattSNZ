I got off to a bit of a slow start today, but I'm feeling pretty good about things now. Discovered this old fork of a friend's theme and decided to use it as my learning log.

Have spent a bit of time messing about to get git and Github linked, but now they're working like a charm. Forking brilliant üç¥

While I'd used GH fairly extensively before today, it had always been via the Mac app or the web UI, so it's been interesting to learn how to do it all via the command line. It makes so much more sense this way!

Have already had to do a bit of googling to unfuck myself in a couple of spots but Stackoverflow came through with the goods.

Will leave it there for today.
