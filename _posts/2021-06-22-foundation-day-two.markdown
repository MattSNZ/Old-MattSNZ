Moved on to branches today. The main branch is essentially your production code. Ideally it has been reviewed and tested. 

We make branches off main in order to make changes to the code and keep them separate and avoid conflicts until we're ready to make it live (ie. it's had a code review and has passed our tests).

I've used these concepts before in a past life, so I'm fairly comfortable with them at this stage.
