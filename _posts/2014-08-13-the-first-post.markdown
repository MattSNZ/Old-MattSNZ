This is my first attempt at using Jekyll. I kinda have no fucking idea what I'm doing.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/885x500" />
    <p class="post-image-caption">Using a little bit of markup, you can add beautiful captions to your totally beautiful pictures. Amazing.</p>
</div>

The code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/rowanoulton/travelog-theme).
